                <h2>What is Olytros: The Musical?</h2>
                <h4>
                    Olytros: The Musical is a brand new project which we started not that long ago, that's why only the rough 
                    story stands. When writing the songs, dialogue and scenes I'll incorporate inspirations from the Odyssey, 
                    the Uncharted games, Shounen Anime and other video games. When writing the songs we take inspiration from

                <h2>What's the story like so far?</h2>
                <h4>
                    The Musical tells the story of the mexican american Leonardo Costas, nickname Leo, who wants to find the 
                    legendary, ancient city of Olytros and his lost father (Ju치n Costas). Together with his two friends Dave 
                    Jones and Jane Evans he starts in his hometown, Long Beach (Mississippi, USA). But on the way there they 
                    get into a storm and strand in Ivory Coast and meet Konan who had heard of the legends of Olytros himself 
                    and joins the group, in hopes that they would get to their goal easier. When they finally find their way 
                    into the mediteranian sea they loose orientation and look for the city in a cave they found. But this cave 
                    is located in Spain which the team doesn't notice. So they go inside and get trapped.
                    <br>
                    To know what happens next you'll have to wait until the musical is finished.

                <h4>
                    Until Epic the Musical: German Edition is complete we probably will have writen enough to share it with the 
                    world. So we'll first finish Epic and then we'll focus on Olytros. We can't call a release date now since 
                    it's unknown when Epic - German Edition will be finished.
